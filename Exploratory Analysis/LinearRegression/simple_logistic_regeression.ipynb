    "Linear regressions assume that the predicted value is quantitative, meaning continuous. However there is times that the predicted value is qualtive, or categorical. In this situation a linear regression algorithimn might not be optimal to predict values. For example if you have 2 values in your predicted categories, a linear regression might give you a predicted value of 1.3. In some situations this is not an optimal prediction as you need a clear 0 or 1 value. \n",
