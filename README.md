# Machine Learning Algorithms from Scratch (on-going)

This repository contains implementations of popular machine learning algorithms built from scratch using Python. The purpose of this project is to demonstrate an understanding of the mathematical and computational principles behind each algorithm by implementing them without the use of high-level machine learning libraries like scikit-learn.

This repository is a great resource for:

- Learning the inner workings of popular machine learning algorithms.
- Practicing and applying machine learning techniques in a hands-on manner.
